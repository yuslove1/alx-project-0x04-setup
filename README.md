# StateCraft: Mastering State Management with Redux & Context API(Task 0 - Counter App with useState)

This is the first task of the "StateCraft" project, focusing on building a simple counter app using React's `useState` hook.  This serves as a starting point for exploring state management in React before introducing more advanced techniques like Redux and Context API.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yuslove1/alx-project-0x04-setup.git

```
2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
cd alx-project-0x04
npm install

```
3. **Run the development seraver:**

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open http://localhost:3000/counter-app in your browser.

## Functionality
The counter app allows you to increment and decrement a counter using buttons. The current count is displayed on the screen. This demonstrates the basic usage of useState for managing component-level state.

## Key Technologies
**React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
**useState Hook:** React hook for managing functional component state.

## Next Steps
This task lays the groundwork for exploring more complex state management solutions in subsequent tasks, including Redux and Context API.
